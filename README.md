# app-throttle
Set Windows app or game process priority (high, normal, low) on-the-fly via hot keys. 

What Is Process Priority? <br>
Process priority in Windows determines how the operating system allocates CPU resources to running applications. Every process is assigned a priority level that influences how often it gets scheduled for execution compared to others. Think of it as giving a task a louder (or quieter) “voice” in asking the CPU for attention. 

App-Throttle supports HIGH, NORMAL and LOW process priority settings for a given app or game. <br>
HIGH: Suitable for tasks that must run promptly like games or video renderings. <br>
NORMAL: Default for most apps - balanced resource sharing. <br>
LOW: Minimum priority, ideal for background applications. 

Usage: <br>
Run App-Throttle.exe. <br>
Set the priority of the active application: <br>
HIGH: CTRL+ALT+H <br> 
NORMAL: CTRL+ALT+N <br> 
LOW: CTRL+ALT+L <br>
<br>
How to start App-Throttle automatically with Windows: <br>
Click start. Type RUN and press ENTER. Type SHELL:STARTUP and press ENTER. <br>
Drag & drop app-throttle.exe to the startup folder with 2nd mouse button and select "Create shortcut here." <br>
App-Throttle will now start with Windows automatically. <br> <br>
